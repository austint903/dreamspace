Welcome to DreamSpace!

Your very own personalized app to help you sleep. 

This app provides features such as a dream journal to record your sleep, a travel section to help you adjust to jetlag, and a section for relaxing music that uses the Spotify API to connect your account to the app while also providing playlist recommendations to help you fall asleep. 

This app was completely made off of React Native.
